      I grew up in the middle of the desert spending most of my time staring at a computer monitor. There isn't alot you can do when the tempurature is almost always over 100Â°! As video games went from Pong to Skyrim, I was there. While most of my first computers were plugged into a television and had weird names like Commodore, Macintosh, and TRS, I was learning how to communicate with them. I guess you could say computing has always been a hobby of mine, and I have been very lucky to have witnessed "history in the making!"
