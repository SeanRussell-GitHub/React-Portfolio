# Professional Portfolio

## **Maintaining A Professional Portfolio**

Being a web developer means being part of a community. Taking part in that community means sharing past and current projects while applying for jobs, or working as a freelancer. Being able to share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects means I'm ready for new projects and prepared for the future.

## **Using React**
This portfolio is just a small example of what is possible with React. 
```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

Youâ€™ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to create a build that you can deploy.

**Important:** Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's build.
